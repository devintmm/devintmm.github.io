I am a historian of the twentieth-century United States, a sexuality studies scholar, and a PhD candidate in American studies at Yale, where I have [taught](/teaching) a wide range of courses on U.S. history and culture. 

[My research](/research) investigates the changing ways that Americans have grappled with the commingling of intimacies—emotional, familial, and sexual—and formations of labor, commerce, and care. As a historian trained in an American Studies program, I am also committed to building connections across disciplines. I am particularly interested in exploring the possibilites opened up by bringing together cultural historical methods and social research, especially in feminist political economy, economic sociology, and critical gerontology.

I am working on two large-scale projects that take up these issues from different angles. The first is my [dissertation](/research#dissertation) (December 2017 defense), "Like A Normal Business: Morality, Economy, and the Making of an Adult Entertainment Industry in the 1970s United States." The second is a history of [sex in later life](/research#elder_intimacies) in the twentieth-century U.S. 

In addition to my individual research, I am a contributor to [two public history projects](/public_history) that seek to leverage digital platforms to stimulate new conversations about the past. I am an editor at [Notches](http://notchesblog.com), a collaborative and international history of sexuality blog, and a producer for [Sexing History](https://www.facebook.com/sexinghistory), an upcoming podcast that examines how the history of sexuality shapes our present.
