I am an interdisciplinary historian of the twentieth- and twenty-first-century United States and a feminist and queer studies scholar. In my teaching, research, and public humanities projects, I aim to facilitate conversations about the changing connections among intimate life—including sex, identity, family, and health—and the politics of knowledge and expertise, regulatory institutions, and economic culture. I hold a Ph.D. in American Studies and graduate certificate in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies from Yale (2018), and am currently a Lecturer on History and Literature at Harvard.

I am at work on my [first book](/research), *For Adults Only: Pornography and the Business of Sexual Revolution*. The book analyzes how, between the 1950s and 1980s, several generations of small- and medium-enterprise owners in the sex media and device trades drew upon the repertoires of postwar business culture and twentieth-century freedom movements to build the modern adult entertainment industry and, in the process, redraw the moral boundaries of the consumer marketplace. 

My newest projects join recent efforts to revive the history of aging and older adults. Together with my collaborator [Prof. Amanda Ciafone](https://media.illinois.edu/media-cinema-studies/ciafone-amanda), I recently co-edited an issue of the Radical History Review on ["Old/Age"](https://read.dukeupress.edu/radical-history-review/issue/2021/139). I am also in research-stage of a book-length project on the history of sex after sixty in the twentieth-century United States. 

In addition to my individual research, I have been a contributor to [two public history projects](/public_history) that seek to leverage digital platforms to stimulate new conversations about the past. I am currently an editor at [Notches](http://notchesblog.com), a collaborative and international history of sexuality blog. Between 2017 and 2019, I was a producer for [Sexing History](sexinghistory.com), a podcast that examines how the history of sexuality shapes our present.
