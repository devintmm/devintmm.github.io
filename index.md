I am an interdisciplinary historian of the twentieth-century United States, with broad interests in erotic and intimate life, knowledge and governance, the life course, the cultural politics of market society, and public history. I hold a Ph.D. in American Studies from Yale (December 2018), and am currently a Lecturer on History and Literature at Harvard.

I am currently at work on my [first book](/research), *From Smut Peddlers to Legitimate Businesses: Illicit Commerce and the Sexual Politics of Business in Modern America*. It shows how, between the 1950s and 1980s, several generations of sex business owners drew upon the repertoires of postwar business culture and 1960s and 1970s social movements to build the modern adult entertainment industry and, in the process, expand the moral boundaries of the consumer marketplace. 

My newest projects join recent efforts to revive the history of aging and old age. I am in the early stages of a book-length project, *Elder Intimacies: A History of Aging and Sexuality in Modern America*, that examines the interplay between changing understandings of sex in old age and the material infrastructures that shaped everyday life in the twentieth-century United States, including residential architecture and planning, the political economy of care, and state investments in health and longevity. I am also co-editing (with Amanda Ciafone and David Serlin) an issue of the Radical History Review on "Critical Histories of Aging and Later Life". 

In addition to my individual research, I am a contributor to [two public history projects](/public_history) that seek to leverage digital platforms to stimulate new conversations about the past. I am an editor at [Notches](http://notchesblog.com), a collaborative and international history of sexuality blog, and a producer for [Sexing History](sexinghistory.com), a podcast that examines how the history of sexuality shapes our present.
