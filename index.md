I am a historian of the twentieth-century United States; an interdisciplinary scholar of gender, sexuality, aging, and economic life; and, from August 1, a Lecturer on History and Literature at Harvard.

[My research](/research) investigates the historical relationships between intimacy and economy, examining the changing ways that Americans have grappled with the commingling of their emotional, familial, and sexual lives with formations of labor, commerce, and care. As a historian trained in an American Studies program, I am also committed to building connections across disciplines. I am particularly interested in exploring the possibilites opened up by bringing together cultural historical methods and social research, especially in feminist political economy, economic sociology, and critical gerontology.

I am currently working on a couple of projects that take up these issues from different angles. The first is my [dissertation](/research#dissertation), "Like A Normal Business: Morality, Economy, and the Making of an Adult Entertainment Industry in the 1970s United States." The second is a history of [sex in later life](/research#elder_intimacies) in the twentieth-century U.S. 

In addition to my individual research, I am a contributor to [two public history projects](/public_history) that seek to leverage digital platforms to stimulate new conversations about the past. I am an editor at [Notches](http://notchesblog.com), a collaborative and international history of sexuality blog, and a producer for [Sexing History](sexinghistory.com), a podcast that examines how the history of sexuality shapes our present.
