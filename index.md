I am a teacher and scholar of United States history and feminist and critical sexuality studies, with broad interests in erotic and intimate life across the life course, "lay" and "expert" social theorizing, governance and regulation, and the cultural politics of market society, particularly in the twentieth century. I hold a Ph.D. in American Studies from Yale (December 2018), and am currently a Lecturer on History and Literature at Harvard.

I am at work on my [first book](/research), *From Smut Peddlers to Legitimate Businesses: Illicit Commerce and the Sexual Politics of Business in Modern America*. The book analyzes how, between the 1950s and 1980s, several generations of sex business owners drew upon the repertoires of postwar business culture and 1960s and 1970s social movements to build the modern adult entertainment industry and, in the process, expand the moral boundaries of the consumer marketplace. 

My newest projects join recent efforts to revive the history of aging. I am in the early stages of a [book-length project](/research) that explores the interplay between changing understandings of sex in old age and the material infrastructures that supported and shaped erotic life for Americans of all ages in the twentieth century, including residential architecture and planning, the gendered and racialized organization of labor and leisure, and state investments in health and longevity. I am also co-editing (with Amanda Ciafone and David Serlin) an issue of the Radical History Review on ["Critical Histories of Aging and Later Life"](http://www.radicalhistoryreview.org/call-for-papers/critical-histories-of-aging-and-later-life/). 

In addition to my individual research, I am a contributor to [two public history projects](/public_history) that seek to leverage digital platforms to stimulate new conversations about the past. I am an editor at [Notches](http://notchesblog.com), a collaborative and international history of sexuality blog, and a producer for [Sexing History](sexinghistory.com), a podcast that examines how the history of sexuality shapes our present.
