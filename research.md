From Smut Peddlers to Legitimate Businesses: Illicit Commerce and the Sexual Politics of Business in Modern America
<br>

"From Smut Peddlers to Legitimate Businesses" examines how, between the 1950s and 1980s, several generations of business people built the modern adult entertainment industry as they sought to transform its image. Revisiting an era in the industry’s history best remembered for the hit film Deep Throat (1972), this project recovers the aspirations and strategies of business owners as they negotiated and contested the porous boundaries between licit and illicit commerce in an era of sexual revolution and political economic transformation. I show how new retail forms (adult bookstores and sex toy shops), evaluative technologies (consumer guides and awards), and advocacy methods (celebrity, public relations, and trade organizations) emerged during this period through the efforts of businesspeople to secure cultural recognition as a “legitimate business,” to be seen as operating according to professional principles in the interest of middle-class, and mixed-sex consumers, rather than being guided only by avarice or, worse, sexual perversion. By analyzing the commercial practices and representational strategies adult business people tested to make their trade licit amid protests from across the political spectrum, this project illuminates surprising synergies between transgression and normalization in the sexual revolution, as well as the role of sexual liberation, political liberalism, and consumer advocacy in advancing the turn toward centrist anti-statism and market rationality in late-twentieth-century politics and culture.

Elder Intimacies: A History of Aging and Sexuality in Modern America

<br>
I am in the beginning stages of research for a second, large-scale project on the history of sex in later life in the twentieth century U.S. At the onset of the twentieth century, medical researchers often defined old age as opposed to sexuality. By century’s end, everyone from television sexperts to Department of Health and Human Services policy writers had come to see sex in old age as not only possible, but also as an important part of aging well. I ask how and why ideas about aging, desire, and emotional wellbeing transformed so dramatically, moving from the micro-scale intimacies among elders and their families to institutional settings like care homes and Medicare public hearings to political economic anxieties centered on population aging. In doing so, I aim to offer a multiscalar account of sexual citizenship that moves beyond sexual identity to consider how public and private infrastructures enable and disable sexual expression in conversation with changing conceptions of capacity, health, and wellbeing.
